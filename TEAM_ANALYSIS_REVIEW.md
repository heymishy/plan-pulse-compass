# Enterprise Team Analysis Review & Improvements

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive review of the team pages and canvas views, I've identified significant opportunities to enhance team composition analysis, cost management, and capacity planning for managing 100+ teams across 50 projects and 400 applications.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths

- ✅ Basic team portfolio overview with utilization metrics
- ✅ Division-level rollups and team capacity tracking
- ✅ Existing financial calculation utilities

- ✅ Basic team size distribution charts

### Critical Gaps Identified

#### 1. **Cost Analysis & Financial Planning**

- ❌ No contractor vs permanent cost comparison
- ❌ Missing cost-per-project and cost-per-application metrics
- ❌ No budget burn rate analysis or forecasting
- ❌ Limited salary benchmarking and cost optimization insights

#### 2. **Team Composition Intelligence**

- ❌ No seniority mix analysis (junior/mid/senior/lead ratios)
- ❌ Missing contractor dependency risk assessment
- ❌ No role distribution optimization recommendations
- ❌ Limited team scaling guidance

#### 3. **Enterprise-Scale Visualization**

- ❌ No multi-dimensional team analysis (size vs cost vs risk)
- ❌ Missing heat maps for risk identification
- ❌ No scenario planning for team growth/reduction
- ❌ Limited cross-team relationship mapping

#### 4. **Strategic Decision Support**

- ❌ No automated recommendations for team formation
