## 📋 Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm: Team-Project Compatibility

```typescript
export function calculateTeamProjectCompatibility(
  team: Team,
  project: Project,
  projectSkills: ProjectSkill[],
  solutions: Solution[],
  skills: Skill[]
): TeamProjectCompatibility {
  // 1. Get all required skills (from project + solutions)
  const requiredSkills = getProjectRequiredSkills(
    project,
    projectSkills,
    solutions,
    skills
  );

  // 2. Calculate exact and category matches
  let exactMatches = 0;
  let categoryMatches = 0;

  // 3. Analyze each required skill
  requiredSkills.forEach(reqSkill => {
    if (team.targetSkills.includes(reqSkill.skillId)) {
      exactMatches++; // Direct skill match
    } else if (teamHasCategorySkill(team, reqSkill.category)) {
      categoryMatches++; // Related skill in same category
    }
  });

  // 4. Calculate compatibility score
  let compatibilityScore = exactMatches / requiredSkills.length;
  const categoryBonus = Math.min(
    0.1,
    (categoryMatches * 0.1) / requiredSkills.length
  );
  compatibilityScore = Math.min(1, compatibilityScore + categoryBonus);

  return {
    compatibilityScore,
    skillsMatched: exactMatches,
    skillsGap: requiredSkills.length - exactMatches,
    recommendation: getRecommendationLevel(compatibilityScore),
    reasoning: generateReasoningText(
      compatibilityScore,
      exactMatches,
      categoryMatches
    ),
  };
}
```

### UI Integration Pattern

```typescript
// Example usage of skills-based filtering
const MyPlanningComponent = () => {
  const [filteredTeams, setFilteredTeams] = useState([]);

  return (
    <div>
      <SkillsBasedTeamFilter
        onFilteredTeamsChange={setFilteredTeams}
        showCompatibilityScores={true}
        minCompatibilityScore={0.5}
      />

      <ProjectTeamRecommendations
        selectedProjectId="project-123"
        maxRecommendations={5}
        showDetailedAnalysis={true}
      />

      <SkillCoverageAnalysis
        showCategoryBreakdown={true}
        showRecommendations={true}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Data Migration (Already Complete)

The team skills data has been successfully migrated from free-text strings to skill IDs:

```typescript
// Before (Broken)
team.targetSkills = ['React', 'Node.js', 'TypeScript'];

// After (Fixed)
team.targetSkills = [
  'skill-react-123',
  'skill-nodejs-456',
  'skill-typescript-789',
];
```

### Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible with existing interfaces.

### Component Updates Required

**None** - All existing components automatically use the new skills system through the centralized AppContext.

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Team Filtering

```typescript
import { filterTeamsBySkills } from '@/utils/skillBasedPlanning';

const { teams, skills } = useApp();
const requiredSkills = ['skill-react-123', 'skill-typescript-789'];
const filteredTeams = filterTeamsBySkills(teams, requiredSkills, skills, 0.7);

console.log(`Found ${filteredTeams.length} teams with 70%+ compatibility`);
```

### Project Team Recommendations

```typescript
import { recommendTeamsForProject } from '@/utils/skillBasedPlanning';

const recommendations = recommendTeamsForProject(
  selectedProject,
  teams,
  projectSkills,
  solutions,
  skills,
  3 // Get top 3 recommendations
);

recommendations.forEach(rec => {
  console.log(
    `${rec.rank}. ${rec.team.name} - ${Math.round(rec.compatibility.compatibilityScore * 100)}% match`
  );
});
```

### Skill Coverage Analysis

```typescript
import { analyzeSkillCoverage } from '@/utils/skillBasedPlanning';

const coverage = analyzeSkillCoverage(teams, skills);

console.log(`Overall coverage: ${coverage.coveragePercentage.toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(
  `Skills at risk: ${coverage.recommendations.skillsAtRisk.join(', ')}`
);
console.log(
  `Well covered: ${coverage.recommendations.skillsWellCovered.join(', ')}`
