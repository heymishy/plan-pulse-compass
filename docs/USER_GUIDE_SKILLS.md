- **Rank 3-4**: Good matches (60-79% compatibility)
- **Rank 5**: Acceptable matches (40-59% compatibility)

### 3. Skill Coverage Analysis

**Location**: Organization dashboard and skills management section

**How to use**:

1. Access the "Skill Coverage" dashboard
2. Review the overall coverage percentage for your organization
3. Examine category breakdowns to understand strengths and weaknesses:
   - **Well Covered** (Green): Skills with 3+ team members

   - **Critical Gap** (Red): Skills with no current team members
4. Review actionable recommendations:
   - **Training Priorities**: Skills to develop in existing team members
   - **Hiring Recommendations**: Skills to prioritize in new hires
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Steps to address critical skill gaps

**Key Metrics to Watch**:

- **Overall Coverage**: Aim for 70%+ across all critical skills
- **Risk Distribution**: Keep "At Risk" skills under 20% of total
- **Category Balance**: Ensure no single category is completely uncovered

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Usage

### Compatibility Scoring Explained

The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to calculate team-project compatibility:

- **Exact Matches**: Direct skill alignment (100% weight)
- **Category Matches**: Related skills in the same category (10% bonus)
- **Coverage Ratio**: Percentage of required skills covered by the team

**Example**: If a project needs 10 skills and a team has 7 exact matches plus 2 category matches:

- Base Score: 7/10 = 70%
- Category Bonus: 2 Ã— 10% = 20% (capped at 10% total)
- Final Score: 70% + 10% = 80% compatibility

### Best Practices

#### For Project Managers

1. **Use Multiple Filters**: Combine skill requirements with other project constraints
2. **Consider Training**: Factor in the team's ability to learn missing skills
3. **Review Recommendations**: Don't just pick the highest-ranked teamâ€”consider context
4. **Plan for Gaps**: Use the gap analysis to plan training or additional resources

#### For Resource Managers

1. **Regular Coverage Reviews**: Check skill coverage monthly or quarterly
2. **Proactive Training**: Address "At Risk" skills before they become critical gaps
3. **Strategic Hiring**: Use coverage analysis to guide recruitment priorities
4. **Cross-Training**: Develop skills in multiple team members to reduce risk

#### For Team Leads

1. **Skill Development**: Use gap analysis to create individual development plans
2. **Project Selection**: Consider skill alignment when accepting new projects
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate skill transfer between team members
4. **Skill Documentation**: Keep team skill profiles up to date

## ðŸ“Š Interpreting Results

### Team Compatibility Scores

- **90-100%**: Perfect match - team has all or nearly all required skills
- **75-89%**: Excellent match - minor gaps that can be addressed through training
- **60-74%**: Good match - some gaps but team has strong foundation
- **45-59%**: Fair match - significant gaps but potential with development
- **Below 45%**: Poor match - consider alternative teams or major training investment

### Skill Coverage Levels

- **High Coverage (3+ teams)**: Skill is well-distributed and low-risk
- **Medium Coverage (2 teams)**: Adequate but monitor for departures
- **Low Coverage (1 team)**: At risk - consider cross-training
- **No Coverage**: Critical gap - immediate attention needed

### Risk Indicators

ðŸ”´ **High Risk**:

- Skills with no team coverage
- Critical project skills with only one expert
- Rapidly changing technology areas with low coverage

ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**:

- Skills with limited team coverage (1-2 people)
- Specialized skills in high-demand project areas
- Skills concentrated in soon-to-retire team members

ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**:

- Skills with broad team coverage (3+ people)
- Well-established technology skills
- Skills with active training programs

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "No Teams Found" Results

- **Cause**: Skill requirements too specific or compatibility threshold too high
- **Solution**: Lower the minimum compatibility score or broaden skill requirements

### Unexpected Team Rankings

- **Cause**: Algorithm considers exact matches more heavily than category matches
- **Solution**: Review the detailed analysis to understand the scoring rationale

### Missing Skills in Analysis

- **Cause**: Skills may not be properly assigned to teams or projects
- **Solution**: Verify skill assignments in team and project management sections

### Performance Issues

- **Cause**: Large datasets can slow down real-time filtering
- **Solution**: Use more specific skill filters or smaller team/project subsets
