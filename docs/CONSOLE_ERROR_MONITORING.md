# Console Error Monitoring System

## Overview

Automated console error monitoring system integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to catch JavaScript/TypeScript errors, React warnings, and other console issues before deployment.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Page Testing**: Tests all 18 application pages automatically
- **Tab Navigation Testing**: Checks console errors when navigating between tabs
- **CI Integration**: Fails builds when critical console errors are detected
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides comprehensive error reports with stack traces and locations
- **Smart Error Filtering**: Excludes common false positives (favicon, DevTools, extensions)

## Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`tests/e2e/page-console-errors.spec.ts`** - Main test file
   - Tests all pages and tabs for console errors
   - Provides detailed error reporting
   - Includes CI-specific failure handling

2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - CI pipeline integration
   - Added `console-error-monitoring` job
   - Runs after quick validation on all pushes and PRs
   - Uploads test artifacts and reports

3. **`package.json`** - New scripts
   - `test:console-errors` - Run tests locally
   - `test:console-errors:ci` - Run tests with CI reporting

4. **`src/components/navigation/breadcrumb-system.tsx`** - Fixed React Fragment errors
   - Resolved `data-lov-id` prop validation issues
   - Eliminated console warnings across all pages

## Usage

### Local Development

```bash
# Run console error monitoring locally
npm run test:console-errors

# Run with detailed reporting
npm run test:console-errors:ci
```

### CI Integration

The monitoring runs automatically on:

- All pushes to main branch
- All pull requests
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Error Categories

**Critical Errors** (Cause CI failure):

- JavaScript runtime errors
- React component errors
- TypeScript errors
- Uncaught exceptions

**Filtered Out** (Non-critical):

- Favicon loading errors
- Browser DevTools messages
- Browser extension messages

## Monitoring Results

### Current Status

- **Total Pages**: 18 tested
- **Success Rate**: 94.4% (17/18 pages clean)
- **Known Issues**: 1 page with errors

### Detected Issues

- **Canvas Page**: `useNodesState is not defined` error in `TeamCostVisualization` component
  - Location: `src/components/canvas/TeamCostVisualization.tsx:461:46`
  - Type: Missing import/undefined variable
  - Impact: Component rendering failure

## Benefits

1. **Early Detection**: Catch console errors before deployment
2. **Automated Testing**: No manual intervention required
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all pages and navigation states
4. **CI Integration**: Prevents broken code from reaching production
5. **Detailed Reporting**: Provides actionable error information with stack traces

## GitHub Actions Integration

The monitoring is integrated as a separate CI job that:

- Runs in parallel with other tests
- Provides GitHub Actions summary with results
- Uploads detailed test artifacts
- Fails the build for critical errors
- Supports retry mechanisms (2 retries in CI)

## Future Enhancements

- Performance metrics monitoring
- Accessibility error detection
- Cross-browser testing expansion
- Custom error threshold configuration
- Integration with monitoring services (Sentry, etc.)
