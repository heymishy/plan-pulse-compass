## Step 4: Check Organization Skill Coverage

### Coverage Dashboard

1. Access **"Skill Coverage Analysis"** from the main dashboard
2. Review your organization's overall skill health
3. Focus on these key metrics:

**🔍 What to Look For:**

- **Overall Coverage**: Aim for 70%+
- **🔴 Critical Gaps**: Skills with zero team coverage (immediate attention needed)
- **🟡 At Risk**: Skills with only 1-2 people (plan for cross-training)
- **🟢 Well Covered**: Skills with 3+ people (you're in good shape)

---

## Step 5: Take Action on Insights

### For Critical Gaps (Red)

- **Immediate**: Plan training for existing team members
- **Short-term**: Prioritize these skills in hiring
- **Risk Mitigation**: Document knowledge and create backup plans

### For At-Risk Skills (Yellow)

- **Cross-train**: Develop these skills in additional team members
- **Monitor**: Watch for departures of key skill holders
- **Plan**: Include in next quarter's training budget

### For Project Assignments

- **Choose**: Start with highest-compatibility teams
- **Plan**: Address skill gaps through training or additional resources
- **Monitor**: Track how skill alignment affects project success
