Team sizes vary between 7-10 people per team.

## Files and Locations

### Core Sample Data

- **`src/data/sampleData.ts`** - Complete sample dataset with 50 teams
- **`src/utils/dataLoader.ts`** - Data loading utilities and validation
- **`src/components/settings/DataInitialization.tsx`** - UI component for loading sample data

### Test Data

- **`src/test/data/testData.ts`** - Smaller, consistent test dataset (4 teams, 16 people)
- **`src/test/utils/testDataLoader.ts`** - Test data loading utilities for CI

## Usage

### 1. Loading Sample Data in the Application

#### Via UI Component

1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Data Initialization
2. Click "Load Full Sample Data" to load all 50 teams
3. Or click "Load Test Data" for a smaller subset

#### Via Code

```typescript
import { loadSampleData } from '@/utils/dataLoader';

// Load complete sample data
const data = loadSampleData({
  loadSampleData: true,
  includeSkills: true,
  includeSolutions: true,
  includeCycles: true,
  includeRunWorkCategories: true,
});

// Apply to context
setDivisions(data.divisions);
setTeams(data.teams);
setPeople(data.people);
setRoles(data.roles);
// ... etc
```

### 2. Using Test Data in CI/Unit Tests

#### Basic Test Data

```typescript
import { loadMinimalTestData } from '@/test/utils/testDataLoader';

const testData = loadMinimalTestData();
// Contains: 2 divisions, 4 teams, 0 people, 4 roles
```

#### People-Focused Test Data

```typescript
import { loadPeopleTestData } from '@/test/utils/testDataLoader';

const testData = loadPeopleTestData();
// Contains: 2 divisions, 4 teams, 16 people, 4 roles, skills, person skills
```

#### Full Test Data

```typescript
import { loadFullTestData } from '@/test/utils/testDataLoader';

const testData = loadFullTestData();
// Contains: Complete test dataset with all entities
```

#### Test Fixtures

```typescript
import { createTestFixture } from '@/test/utils/testDataLoader';

const testData = createTestFixture('people'); // 'minimal' | 'people' | 'full'
```

### 3. Data Validation

#### Validate Sample Data

```typescript
import { validateLoadedData } from '@/utils/dataLoader';

const validation = validateLoadedData(data);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Validation errors:', validation.errors);
}
```

#### Validate Test Data

```typescript
import { validateTestData } from '@/test/utils/testDataLoader';

const validation = validateTestData(testData);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Validation errors:', validation.errors);
}
```

### 4. Helper Functions

#### Sample Data Helpers

```typescript
import {
  getTeamById,
  getDivisionById,
  getPeopleByTeamId,
  getTeamsByDivisionId,
  getRoleById,
} from '@/data/sampleData';

const team = getTeamById('team-001');
const division = getDivisionById('div-001');
const teamPeople = getPeopleByTeamId('team-001');
const divisionTeams = getTeamsByDivisionId('div-001');
const role = getRoleById('role-po');
```

#### Test Data Helpers

```typescript
import {
  getTestTeamById,
  getTestDivisionById,
  getTestPeopleByTeamId,
  getTestTeamsByDivisionId,
  getTestRoleById,
} from '@/test/data/testData';

const team = getTestTeamById('team-test-001');
const division = getTestDivisionById('div-test-001');
const teamPeople = getTestPeopleByTeamId('team-test-001');
const divisionTeams = getTestTeamsByDivisionId('div-test-001');
const role = getTestRoleById('role-test-po');
```

2. **Integration Tests**: Use `loadPeopleTestData()` for integration scenarios
3. **E2E Tests**: Use `loadFullTestData()` for comprehensive testing
4. **Data Validation**: All data is validated before use in tests

## Best Practices

1. **Use Test Data for CI**: Always use the test data files for automated testing
2. **Validate Data**: Always validate data before using it in production scenarios
3. **Consistent IDs**: Test data uses predictable IDs (e.g., `team-test-001`)
4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Sample data represents realistic banking team structures
5. **Extensible**: Easy to extend with additional teams, skills, or solutions

## Future Enhancements

The sample data structure is designed to be easily extensible:

- Add more divisions (e.g., Investment Banking, Wealth Management)
- Include more specialized roles (e.g., Data Scientist, UX Designer)
- Add more domain-specific skills
- Include project templates and common epics
- Add historical data for trend analysis

## Support

For questions about the sample data or help extending it, refer to:

- The data files themselves for structure examples
- The test files for usage patterns
- The validation functions for data integrity checks
