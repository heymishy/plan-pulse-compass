TO DO
 - fix PO display on team listing
 - fix epic page broken error

 - confirm % rounding on planning page

 - look into quarterly team plan import

 - sample planning allocation looks for iterations 1 to 5 but iteration 6 ends up 1200%, 1400% or 1500% per team - each iteration should really be only 100% but overallocations of 0% to 200% would be acceptable imports and then edit/reimport

 - swimlanes or groupings on planning page for division
 - rollout of quarter summary per team
 - toggle to hide iterations / team rows with no allocations
 - extra + in lane when allocation less than 100% exists
 - shortname for project
 - priority for projects

ability to import just peoples names
 - unallocated person to team feature - with filters for teams, divisions. good UX to map each person to a team

what ar emain 3 scenarios for customer/me

 - import improvements, mapping UI

 - milestone to project details
